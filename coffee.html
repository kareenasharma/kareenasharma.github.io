          A mobile application for patrons of the Chicago Public Library.
          Through Coffee, patrons receive personalized recommendations of media and activities offered by the library to engage in.
          Additionally, they can connect with their community through their friends' activity feed and by sharing and reading reviews. </h2>

        <!--Background section-->
        <h2 class="subtitle">Background</h2>
        <h2 class = "portfolioDescription" id = "bodyText"> With the rapid developments in technology, libraries have seen a significant decrease in 
            community engagement. We wanted to determine how we could redefine libraries for the 21st century.
            Specifically, we wanted to know how we might foster a stronger community by increasing the engagement of 
            library patrons. We conducted observations at libraries, studied articles online, and interviewed library staff 
            members to better understand how patrons were currently engaging with their libraries. 
            We also wanted to understand the system that the library staff uses to generate ideas, promote events/media, 
            and collect feedback for future improvements.</h2>
        
        <!--Research section-->
        <h2 class="subtitle">Research</h2>
        <h2 class = "portfolioDescription" id="bodyText"> Through our research, we determined two main issues with the library's current system of creating and tracking engagement at events:
            â€‹
            Impersonal advertising: Current means of event publicity (newsletters, websites, etc.) are impersonal. 
            When people see events they do not connect to, they assume that the library does not offer activities that would 
            interest them. As a result, they become disinterested in engaging altogether.
            Lack of success measurement: Staff attempts to take a headcount at events and offers an 
            optional comment card. Beyond this, they have no way of knowing which events were successful and why, 
            and therefore cannot improve on future events." </h2>

        seemingly traditional institutions and modern social networking. Throughout the project, our mentors pushed us 
        to find the "soul" in our project. Incorporating the personality quiz offered a more tailored and personal experience 
        for users, which I feel elevated it beyond a social calendar app. </h2>
